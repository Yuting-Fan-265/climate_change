    "text": "If the charts are not visible, please try refreshing the website.\nClimate change is no longer a future threat. We are presently witnessing its effects in the Four Corners Region through modifications to the water and vegetation resources. Because anticipated increases in precipitation will probably be countered by warming temperatures that will increase evaporation rates, the Four Corners Region is expected to become drier and warmer in the future. The distribution of plants and animals in parks will shift due to climate change, which will alter ecosystem functions. Climate change has an impact on all of the vital indications associated with natural resources in the Four Corners Region.\nNatural Bridges National Monument is a U.S. National Monument located about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of the Four Corners boundary of southeast Utah, in the western United States.1 According to data from the US Geological Survey (USGS), we can observe specific climate change impacts at the Natural Bridges National Monument."

The minimum winter temperature also saw a significant increase starting in 2010, rising from -25 degrees Celsius to a peak of -8.17 degrees Celsius in 2022.\nA similar trend is observed in the summer. The average summer temperature has steadily increased since 2014, reaching a record high of 24.53 degrees Celsius in 2022, the highest in 43 years. Additionally, the maximum summer temperature has not dropped below 35 degrees Celsius since 2009. From 2021 to 2024, nearly all temperature types have been above the 43-year average."

Since 2018, total precipitation in both summer and winter has consistently been below the 43-year average, failing to reach even 10 centimeters in 2021 and 2022. The combination of higher temperatures and lower precipitation is causing significant water stress for the Monument."

This trend correlates with the increase in summer temperatures. This indicates that, despite consistent precipitation levels, the amount of available water is decreasing. Consequently, the water available for plants and animals is also being reduced."

Typically, the volumetric water content is higher in winter and lower in summer. Although there was a rebound in 2024, the volumetric water content nearly reached its lowest point in over 43 years in 2022 and 2023. The amount of water available to plants is greatly threatened, highlighting the impact of climate change on the region. It is crucial to address this issue by developing plant protection plans and implementing appropriate measures."
